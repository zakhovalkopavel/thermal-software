    """Possible temperatures of each isotherm group (lines continuing across boundaries share a group).

    Every group starts with the multiples of ``step_C`` up to 4000 °C, a group in ``labels`` with
    its read value. A ladder ``(groups, low, high)`` lists the groups crossing one boundary stretch
    between two points of known temperature, in order from the ``low`` end to the ``high`` end
    (the liquidus rises monotonically along the stretch): each lies strictly between ``low`` and
    ``high`` and strictly above the previous one. Ladders are added one at a time, longest first,
    each propagated with the ones already accepted until nothing changes; a ladder that leaves a
    group without any temperature (a line crossing the stretch twice, or one end of a line put on
    the wrong boundary) is rejected.
    ``chains`` (neighbouring lines in order across a field) are added after the ladders, longest
    first, in the same way: each line one ``step_C`` from the previous one, all rising or all falling.
    Returns the sorted options per group (one = determined), the indices of the rejected ladders and
    of the rejected chains.
