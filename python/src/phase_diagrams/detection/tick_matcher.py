    Values are listed in the order of increasing pixels (left to right, top to
    bottom). Every pair of candidates is tried as two consecutive values. Order:
    most matched values; then most ``anchors`` agreeing within half a tick
    spacing (approximate ``(value, pixel)`` pairs from labelled invariant seeds,
    which resolves evenly spaced ticks shifted by one); then only spacings
    ≥ 75 % of the widest remain (minor ticks between listed values are skipped);
    then the smallest mean error. ``frame_ends`` (the frame line positions at
    both ends of the edge) are added as candidates so the frame can stand in
    for outer ticks.
