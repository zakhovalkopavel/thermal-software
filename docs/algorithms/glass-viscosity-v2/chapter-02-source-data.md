# Chapter 2: Source Data and Traceability

**Part I: Background and Approach**

---

## Overview

Every coefficient used in this spec is sourced from one of two papers. This chapter documents exactly which CSV file provides which data, what each column means, and critical encoding details that must be understood before implementing.

```

**Column meaning:**
- Rows: oxide component names (network-neutral term is "Constant")
- Columns: the three viscosity levels, in **log₁₀ poise**; to convert to Pa·s subtract 1

**Critical:** The compositions are **NOT in wt%**. They are in **parts per 100 parts of SiO₂ by weight** (see Chapter 6 for the conversion algorithm).

**Note on B₂O₃:** There are two rows — a linear term `B₂O₃` and a quadratic term `(B₂O₃)²`. The quadratic term captures the boron anomaly (viscosity does not respond linearly to B₂O₃). When evaluating, add both: `coefficient_B * x_B + coefficient_B2 * x_B²`.

**Note on missing SiO₂:** SiO₂ has no row because the composition encoding already expresses everything relative to 100 parts SiO₂. SiO₂ is the implicit reference.

#### `page_002_table_006.csv` — VTF constant regression coefficients

This table gives regression coefficients to directly compute the VTF constants A, B, T₀ from composition. It is an **alternative path** — not used in the two-stage architecture of this spec, but documented for completeness.

```
,B,A,T₀
Constant,6237.013,1.713,149.4
Al2O3,15.21,-0.0087,1.4
Na2O,-66.01,-0.0162,0.5
K₂O,-5.41,0.0066,-2.36
Li₂O,-115.18,-0.0318,-13.29
CaO,-60.63,0.0064,7.71
MgO,56.21,0.0589,-2.12
BaO,-21.03,0.0026,1.09
ZnO,-3.76,0.016,0.96
PbO,-25.44,-0.005,0.82
B₂O3,-155.11,-0.0465,12.03
(B₂O₃)²,4.0999,0.001627,-0.2765
```

**Why not used in this spec:** The two-stage architecture (isokom → VTF fit) uses `page_001_table_007.csv` to get the three isokom temperatures, then fits VTF analytically. This is numerically more transparent and avoids compounding two layers of regression error.

**Equation form used in this table:**
```
T = B_constant / (log η [poise] + A_constant) + T₀_constant
```
Note the `+A` form (not `−T₀` as a denominator) — this is Lakatos's convention which differs from the A + B/(T−T₀) convention used elsewhere in this spec.

#### `page_002_table_007.csv` — Standard deviations

```
at log η,2,σ=4.63°C
at log η,4,σ=3.34°C
at log η,6,σ=3.14°C
```

These are the reported residual standard deviations from the regression fit. They represent the typical accuracy of the model on the training dataset.

**Used in Chapter 9** for confidence estimation: a 95% confidence interval on each predicted isokom temperature is approximately ±2σ.

#### `page_003_table_001.csv` — Validation dataset Part A

Contains 30 glass compositions from series S (first section without series label), F₂ (flat glass type 2), and others.

**Column structure:**
```
Nr, SiO2, Al2O3, Na2O, K2O, Li2O, CaO, MgO, BaO, ZnO, PbO, B2O3,
Calc.T@log η 2, ΔT@log η 2,
Calc.T@log η 4, ΔT@log η 4,
Calc.T@log η 6, ΔT@log η 6
```

Where:
- Columns 2–12 are composition in **wt%** (raw input, not parts/SiO₂)
- "Calc. T" columns are the temperatures predicted by the Lakatos model (°C)
- "ΔT" = Calculated − Measured (positive means model predicts higher than reality)

#### `page_004_table_002.csv` — Validation dataset Part B

Same column structure as Part A. Contains groups FAL (fluoroaluminosilicate glasses) and others.

### Source Files

All files are in `shared/sources/fluegel_2007/`.

#### `fluegel_2006.txt`
Full OCR text of the paper. Essential context for understanding the model's statistical methodology, systematic error corrections applied to the SciGlass database, and the mixed alkali model.

#### `Fluegel_table1.csv` — Reference glass compositions (wt%)

Seven standard glasses used for model validation. Columns (left to right):

| Column | Glass ID | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | CO — Soda-lime-silica container | Simple composition, widely modelled |
| 2 | NIST SRM 710A | Certified viscosity standard |
| 3 | NIST SRM 717A | Borosilicate standard |
| 4 | 711 | Lead crystal standard |
| 5 | 710 | Soda-lime standard (older) |
| 6 | DGG I | German standard glass |
| 7 | WGS — Waste glass standard | Complex multi-component composition |

**Units:** wt%. These must be converted to mol% excluding SiO₂ before use with Fluegel coefficients.

#### `Fluegel_table2.csv` — Model comparison at log η = 1.5 Pa·s

Lists predicted melting-point temperatures from 15 published models for the 7 reference glasses. The last row "This work" corresponds to the Fluegel 2007 model. Used as context data; not directly needed for implementation.

#### `Fluegel_table3.csv` — Composition validity ranges

Maximum mol% (excluding SiO₂) for each component at each viscosity level. **Used for range validation**.

```
Component, max at log η 1.5, max at log η 6.6, max at log η 12
SiO2 min., 42.62, 42.62, 41.4

MgO, 16.9, 20, 16.61
Na2O, 44, 42, 42
PbO, 49.96, 50, 56
SrO, 7.37, 7.37, 18.02
TiO2, 9.26, 3.29, 25
ZnO, 5.19, 8, 2.81
ZrO2, 9.78, 2.77, 1.76
... (full table in CSV)
```

**Zero entries** in the table mean the component was not present in training data at that viscosity level — a zero should be treated as "not applicable / not validated" rather than "maximum is zero."

**SiO₂** has both a min and max entry because it is expressed here in mol% of the total composition (not as the encoding reference). These bounds are checked directly on the SiO₂ mol% value.

## Critical Encoding Notes

### ⚠️ Poise vs Pa·s (1 log unit offset)

Lakatos 1976 uses **log η in poise**. Fluegel 2007 and ASTM C965-96 use **log η in Pa·s**.

```
log η (Pa·s) = log η (poise) − 1
```

When feeding Lakatos isokom temperatures into the VTF fitting stage, the viscosity labels must be converted:
- Lakatos "log η = 2" poise → **log η = 1** Pa·s
- Lakatos "log η = 4" poise → **log η = 3** Pa·s
- Lakatos "log η = 6" poise → **log η = 5** Pa·s

Failure to apply this conversion causes a **systematic 10× error** in viscosity at every predicted temperature.

### ⚠️ Lakatos Composition Encoding

Input wt% must be transformed to **parts per 100 parts of SiO₂ by weight** before multiplying by the Lakatos coefficients. This is NOT the same as wt%. See Chapter 6 for the exact algorithm.

Example: A glass with SiO₂ = 72 wt%, Na₂O = 14 wt%, CaO = 10 wt% becomes:
- Na₂O = 14/72 × 100 = 19.44 parts per 100 SiO₂
- CaO = 10/72 × 100 = 13.89 parts per 100 SiO₂

### ⚠️ Fluegel Composition Encoding

Input wt% must be converted to mol%, and then SiO₂ is **excluded** — the remaining components are expressed as mol% of the total (not renormalized). See Chapter 6 for the exact algorithm.

Example: A glass with SiO₂ = 72 wt%, Na₂O = 14 wt%, CaO = 10 wt%:
1. Convert to moles: SiO₂ = 72/60.08 = 1.198, Na₂O = 14/61.98 = 0.226, CaO = 10/56.08 = 0.178
2. Total moles = 1.602 (sum of all components)
3. Total mol% of each = (moles/total) × 100
4. **Exclude SiO₂** — use only the non-SiO₂ mol% values as inputs C_i
